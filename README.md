# Skins Pro — **Next-Gen Home Assistant Dashboard**

[中文版本](README.zh-CN.md)

**Next-Gen Home Assistant Dashboard** — Multi-skin, immersive, plug-and-play.

Skins Pro is a community Lovelace card with a multi-skin architecture. It ships with the **modern** skin and offers additional skins via the built-in skin store. Bilingual (CN/EN) — install from HACS and it just works.

- Add via HACS custom repository
- Switch between skins freely
- Fullscreen Kiosk mode for immersive experience
- Auto image processing on build (resize, JPG convert)
- Area-based room display
- Auto icon matching by entity domain

> Note — We often create skins out of passion for the things we like, but this can inadvertently touch on copyright issues. We recommend using AI-generated images whenever possible. All current theme image assets are AI-generated, so some images may contain AI watermarks or similar generation artifacts. If you don't like the AI-generated images, you can freely upload your own background and room images in the settings. If you believe any skin infringes on your copyright, please open an issue and we will remove it promptly.

## Philosophy

Keep it simple, keep it easy.

Skins Pro is built around simplicity and ease of use. Install from HACS, pick a skin, adjust a few settings in the card editor, and you're done. Every feature is designed to be intuitive, so you can focus on enjoying your smart home.

## Installation

## Skin Store

![Store](https://github.com/ha-china/Skins-Pro/raw/screenshot-assets/store.gif)

Download additional skins directly from the card editor. Clicking **Download** fetches the skin package from the CDN and installs it to your HA `www/` directory via the [`skins-pro-hass`](https://github.com/ha-china/skins-pro-hass) integration.

> The integration is only needed for downloading skins from the store. If you only use the built-in **modern** skin, you can skip installing it.

## Built-in Skin

| Skin | Style | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **modern** (default) | White glassmorphism | Frosted glass, high-res images, clean blue-white palette, built-in dark mode |

> All other skins (AEON, AEON_glass, visionOS, minecraft, and community submissions) are available via the **Skin Store** built into the card editor. Click the store button to browse and download.

## Skin Development

A skin is a folder under `skins-pro/<skin-name>/` containing images, CSS, and strings. `npm run build` auto-discovers, processes images, and generates code.

### Directory Structure

```
skins-pro/
  your-skin-name/
    theme.css               # Styles (required)
    strings.json            # Strings + icon_map + author + version (required)
    avatar.jpg              # Avatar, recommended ≥ 300×300
    background.jpg          # Background, recommended width ≥ 2560px
    decoration.jpg          # Side decoration, recommended height ≥ 400px
    base-texture.jpg        # Base texture, recommended width ≥ 2560px
    stage-*.jpg             # Stage image, recommended width ≥ 2560px
    room-*.jpg              # Room image, recommended width ≥ 1200px
    icon-*.jpg              # Device icon, recommended longest edge ≥ 300px
```

### Dark Mode Assets (optional)

To support dark mode, place `-dark` variants alongside the originals — same extension, with `-dark` appended before the extension:

```
skins-pro/your-skin-name/
  background-dark.jpg      # Dark variant of background.jpg
  icon-light-dark.jpg      # Dark variant of icon-light.jpg
  room-living-dark.jpg     # Dark variant of room-living.jpg
  ...                      # One -dark file per original
```

Also add `:host([data-sp-theme="dark"]) { ... }` in `theme.css` to override CSS variables for dark colors. See `src/skins/modern/theme.css` for a reference implementation.

### Image Processing on Build

| Pattern | Recommended source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `room-*` | width ≥ 1200px | Maintain ratio, downscale to 1200px |
| `icon-*` | longest edge ≥ 300px | Maintain ratio, downscale to 300px |
| `avatar.*` | longest edge ≥ 300px | Maintain ratio, downscale to 300px |
| `decoration.*` | height ≥ 400px | Maintain ratio, downscale to height 400px |
| `background.*`, `base-*`, `stage-*` | width ≥ 2560px | Maintain ratio, downscale to 2560px |
| others | width ≥ 1200px | Maintain ratio, downscale to 1200px |

Supports PNG / JPG / BMP / WebP input. Icons, avatars, and decorations output as PNG; everything else as JPG. Never upscales.

### theme.css

All styles are customized via CSS variables on `:host`. Each skin has its own `theme.css`. See `src/skins/modern/theme.css` for the full variable list.

### strings.json + icon_map + author + version

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "your-github-username",
  "title_zh": "欢迎回来！",
  "title_en": "Welcome back!",
  "icon_map": {
    "light": "light",
    "switch": "switch",
    "climate": "climate",
    "media_player": "speaker",
    "lock": "lock"
  }
}
```

- `version` — Skin version string (e.g. `"1.0.0"`). Displayed in the store.
- `author` — Your GitHub username (without `@`). Displayed in the store and linked to your profile.
- `icon_map` — Maps entity domains to icon image filenames. Unmapped domains fall back automatically.

> **Best reference** — Use [`visionOS/`](https://github.com/ha-china/Skins-Pro/tree/skin-assets/visionOS) as the starting point when creating a new skin. It has the most complete `icon_map`, `theme.css`, and icon assets.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ha-china/Skins-Pro.git
cd Skins-Pro
npm install
npm run build       # Build everything
npm run build -- <skin-name>   # Build only one skin + modern (faster)
npm run build -- <skin-name> --skins-only   # Process skin images only, no JS rebuild
npm run watch       # Auto-rebuild on file changes
npm run type-check  # Check for code errors
```

`npm run build -- visionOS` builds only `modern` + `visionOS`, skipping other skins — faster when iterating on a single skin.

`npm run build -- visionOS --skins-only` processes only the skin's images and outputs to `dist/visionOS/` — no JS rebuild, no zip packaging. Use this when you already have a working `dist/skins-pro.js` and just want to update skin images.

Build output in `dist/`:

- `dist/skins-pro.js` — The main JS file (the only file you need for HA)
- `dist/modern/` — The built-in modern skin's images and CSS

### Testing in Home Assistant

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Copy `dist/skins-pro.js` to your HA `www/` folder:**
   ```
   <HA config>/www/skins-pro.js
   ```

3. **Add it as a dashboard resource in Home Assistant:**  
   Settings → Dashboards → Resources → Add Resource
   - URL: `/local/skins-pro.js`
   - Type: JavaScript Module

4. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R) your browser.

   After that, every time you `npm run build`, just replace `www/skins-pro.js` and hard refresh to see changes.

> **Tip** — If the built-in **modern** skin images or styles are not loading, also copy `dist/modern/` to `www/community/skins-pro/modern/`:
> ```
> <HA config>/www/community/skins-pro/modern/  ← copy dist/modern/ here
> ```

### Testing a New Skin Locally

You don't need the store to test a new skin. Just:

1. Create your skin folder under `skins-pro/<new-skin-name>/` with the usual files (`theme.css`, `strings.json`, images)

2. Run `npm run build -- <new-skin-name> --skins-only` — processes only your skin's images, outputs to `dist/<new-skin-name>/`

3. Copy `dist/<new-skin-name>/` to your HA `www/` folder:
   ```
   <HA config>/www/skins-pro/<new-skin-name>/
     ├── theme.css
     ├── avatar.jpg
     ├── background.jpg
     ├── room-*.jpg
     ├── icon-*.jpg
     └── ... (all files from your skin directory)
   ```

4. In the Skins Pro card editor, add the skin name to `downloaded_skins`:
   ```json
   "downloaded_skins": ["<new-skin-name>"]
   ```
   This tells the card the skin is already installed, so it shows up in the skin dropdown right away. Select it and hard refresh.

That's it — no store, no PR needed for local testing. When you're happy with the result, open a PR to share it.

## Contributing a Skin

We welcome skin contributions! Simply:

1. **Create a skin folder** under `skins-pro/<skin-name>/` with the required files (see [Skin Development](#skin-development) above)
2. **Add a preview screenshot** `screenshots/<skin-name>.png` (1920×1080 recommended)
3. **Submit a PR** using the PR template — fill in all required fields

Once merged, CI automatically builds the card and makes it available in the card editor's skin store.

> ⚠️ **Copyright Notice** — When contributing skins, please ensure your image assets do not infringe on others' copyright. We recommend using AI-generated or original images. Skins with valid copyright complaints will be removed from the store.

After submitting, a bot will automatically post a **Screenshot Preview** comment showing your skin's preview image.

### Required Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `theme.css` | All styles via CSS variables on `:host`. See `src/skins/modern/theme.css` |
| `strings.json` | Greeting text + `icon_map`. **Must** include a non-empty `author` field |
| `avatar.*` (png/jpg) | Avatar image, recommended ≥ 300×300 |
| `background.*` (png/jpg) | Main background, recommended width ≥ 2560px |
| `screenshots/<skin-name>.png` | Store preview image. **Filename must match the skin folder name exactly** |

### Tips

- Use [`visionOS/`](https://github.com/ha-china/Skins-Pro/tree/skin-assets/visionOS) as the reference — it has the most complete `icon_map` and assets
- Images are auto-processed on build (resize, JPG output) — no manual optimization needed
- `icon_map` in `strings.json` maps entity domains to icon filenames; unmapped domains fall back automatically
